1. DAX, which stands for Data Analysis Expressions, is a formula language used in Power BI, Power Pivot, and Analysis Services to perform calculations, 
  create custom measures, and define relationships between data tables. It is a powerful and versatile language designed specifically for working with tabular data models. 

2. Datasets: Datasets are the foundation of Power BI and represent the collection of data that you import or connect to from various sources. 
  A dataset is a structured set of tables that contain the actual data you want to analyze. These tables can be sourced from files, databases, online services, 
  or other data connectors. Datasets organize and store the underlying data, including its structure, relationships between tables, and metadata.

  Reports: Reports in Power BI are interactive visualizations that display data from one or more datasets. A report is a collection of visual elements, 
  such as charts, tables, matrices, and images, that represent the data in a visually appealing and informative manner. Reports allow users to explore, analyze, 
  and present data insights based on the underlying dataset.

  Dashboards: Dashboards provide a high-level summary view of key metrics and visualizations from one or more reports and datasets. A dashboard is a single canvas 
  that allows you to combine visualizations, tiles, and other elements from multiple reports into a single view. Dashboards provide a consolidated and customizable 
  overview of critical information, enabling users to monitor and track key performance indicators (KPIs) at a glance.
